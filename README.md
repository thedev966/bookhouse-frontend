# BookHouse App

BookHouse is the best online bookstore out there? Just kidding, but truth be told, this was one of my longest-to-complete projects. As a result, I've learned and improved my skills more than I expected. I've fully designed and developed it, including auth system, cart and integration with Stripe payments.

Tech used:
- React
- Redux
- Vanila CSS
- Node
- MongoDB
- JWT
- Stripe API
- GraphQL
- Apollo Client
